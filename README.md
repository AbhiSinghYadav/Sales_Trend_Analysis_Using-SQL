# Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze **monthly revenue** and **order volume** from the online sales dataset using SQL aggregation techniques.

---

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `Online Sales Data.csv`  
**Table Name:** `sales`

**Columns:**
- `transaction_id` → Unique order identifier
- `date` → Date when the order was placed
- `product_id` → Unique product identifier
- `amount` → Revenue amount for the order

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** (You can also use MySQL or SQLite)
- **pgAdmin** for database management
- CSV Import feature for loading data

---

## 🗂 Steps Performed
1. **Table Creation**  
   Created a table `online_sales` with appropriate data types for all columns.
2. **Data Import**  
   Imported the `Online Sales Data.csv` into PostgreSQL using the `COPY` command or pgAdmin's Import Tool.
3. **Data Exploration**  
   Checked the table content and column details.
4. **Sales Trend Analysis**  
   - Extracted year and month from the `order_date`.
   - Calculated **monthly total revenue** using `SUM(amount)`.
   - Counted **unique orders per month** using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`.
   - Ordered results in chronological order.
   - Found the **Top 3 months** by sales revenue.
   - Found the **month with lowest sales**.
   - Calculated **average revenue per order** for each month.
   - Filtered months with revenue > 50,000.
5. **Product-wise Trend**  
   Analyzed sales trends for each product by month.
